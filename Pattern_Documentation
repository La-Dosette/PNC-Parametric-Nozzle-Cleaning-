## 🧠 Pattern Risk Order & Justification

PNC patterns are intentionally ordered from **lowest to highest mechanical risk**.  
Users are encouraged to start with the safest patterns and only escalate if cleaning is insufficient.

Each pattern below is presented with its **mechanical role**, **risk level**, and **recommended use case**.

---

### 🟩 SCRUB Pattern  
**Risk level:** Very Low  
**Recommended as:** First step / Frequent use

**Mechanical principle**  
Short, fast lateral movements with minimal pressure and limited contact time.

**Why it exists**  
Designed to remove light residue and surface contamination without stressing:
- the toolhead
- the brush
- the kinematics

**Use this pattern when**
- cleaning between prints
- refreshing the nozzle surface
- testing Z contact safely

**Notes**
- Not suitable for hardened blobs
- Very forgiving in terms of Z and speed tuning

---

### 🟦 W Pattern  
**Risk level:** Low  
**Recommended as:** Default cleaning pattern

**Mechanical principle**  
Balanced back-and-forth motion with controlled direction changes.

**Why it exists**  
Provides predictable, symmetrical cleaning without biasing force in one direction.

**Use this pattern when**
- performing routine cleaning
- calibrating the system
- cleaning after normal prints

**Notes**
- Best first pattern to tune
- Minimal mechanical stress
- Works well on most materials

---

### 🟨 BOX Pattern  
**Risk level:** Medium  
**Recommended as:** Deep cleaning

**Mechanical principle**  
Rectangular motion that maximizes contact time and pressure rather than speed.

**Why it exists**  
Some residue requires **time under pressure**, not shear force.

**Use this pattern when**
- dealing with smeared or soft filament
- cleaning sticky materials (PETG, TPU)
- W pattern is not sufficient

**Notes**
- Speed should be kept low
- Avoid excessive Z depth on soft brushes
- Highly effective but slower

---

### 🟥 SAW Pattern  
**Risk level:** High  
**Recommended as:** Last resort / Targeted use

**Mechanical principle**  
Directional sawtooth motion applying alternating lateral shear forces.

**Why it exists**  
Designed to mechanically break hardened blobs and stubborn residue that resist wiping.

**Use this pattern when**
- visible blobs remain
- filament hooks are present
- printer was idle with a hot nozzle

**Notes**
- Most aggressive pattern
- Requires correct Z calibration
- Should not be the default pattern

---

## 🎯 Recommended Usage Strategy

1. Start with **SCRUB**
2. Use **W** as your default
3. Add **BOX** if deeper cleaning is needed
4. Use **SAW** only when necessary

PNC does not enforce a workflow,  
but this order minimizes risk while maximizing effectiveness.
